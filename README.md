# Prowess
Addon that shows tooltip info if your mouseover target has a learnable pet ability. To install, download this repository, rename the folder `prowess`, and move to your `interface/addons` directory.


## Supported abilities
* Bite
* Claw
* Dash
* Prowl


## Where is the rest?
There is no way I am copy/pasting spell- and creature ids for things that I have no intention of using. If you have spare time and want to get carpel tunnel syndrome, feel free to update `datahase.lua` with any missing abilities. Sorry!! :)
