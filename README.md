# Prowess
Addon that shows tooltip info if your mouseover target has a learnable pet ability. If your pet is summoned and already knows the ability, it will be hidden from the tooltip. I have not found a way to check if the hunter knows the ability (but has not taught the pet). If you know how to do this, please let me know.


## Installing
* Download this repository.
* Rename the folder `prowess`. Remember to remove any excessive folders; there should only be one folder containing all the files.
* Move to your `interface/addons` directory.
* Restart your game to load the addon.


## Supported abilities
* Bite
* Claw
* Dash
* Prowl


## Where is the rest?
There is no way I am copy/pasting spell- and creature ids for things that I have no intention of using. If you have spare time and want to get carpel tunnel syndrome, feel free to update `datahase.lua` with any missing abilities. Sorry!! :)
